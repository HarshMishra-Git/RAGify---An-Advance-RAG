- Emerging Markets: 4.9%
- Developing Economies: 5.3%

China's economic restructuring has successfully transitioned from export-dependency to domestic consumption, maintaining 5.1% growth despite demographic challenges. India leads global growth at 7.4%, benefiting from manufacturing relocation and digital service exports.

## Energy Transition Economics

The renewable energy sector now employs 42 million people globally, exceeding fossil fuel industry employment for the first time in history. Green hydrogen production costs have fallen 68% since 2022, making it economically viable for industrial applications and heavy transport.

Investment in climate adaptation infrastructure has reached $840 billion annually, creating an estimated 12 million jobs worldwide while reducing projected climate-related economic losses by an estimated $3.2 trillion over the next decade.

## Digital Currency Adoption

Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are now operational in 28 countries, representing 64% of global GDP. The Digital Yuan leads with 970 million active users, while the Digital Euro and Digital Dollar have achieved adoption rates of 38% and 26% respectively in their regions.

## Labor Market Transformation

Automation has displaced 18 million manufacturing and service jobs since 2023, while creating 24 million new positions in technology, green energy, and healthcare sectors. The four-day workweek has become standard in 40% of advanced economy workplaces, with productivity data showing an average 8% output increase despite reduced hours.

The gig economy has stabilized at 28% of the global workforce, with new labor regulations in Europe and parts of Asia establishing minimum protections for contract workers.

## Supply Chain Resilience

Regionalization of supply chains continues, with 62% of multinational corporations reporting significant reshoring or nearshoring initiatives. North American manufacturing capacity has increased 34% since 2022, while Southeast Asian manufacturing hubs in Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand have seen 47% growth.

Advanced manufacturing techniques including distributed 3D printing networks and autonomous factories have reduced production costs by an average of 23% while improving supply chain resilience.
